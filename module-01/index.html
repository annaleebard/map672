			<p>As the Floating Sheep manifesto states the true coder, cartographer, or critic types only exist in the wild. After thoroughly enjoying time away from formal education I decided I wanted to learn how to make maps and I re-enrolled at the University of Kentucky in 2009. Over the last 6 years my goal has remained the same yet it has been totally re-imagined. Through these years of this re-imagining I have identified with the three types (now heavy on the excited and totally inexperienced coder side). I have learned that making maps is more than a hard skill and a particular technique. My priority moving forward with mapping is that I continue to learn. This seems to now a need in the flexible and dynamic world of web mapping but, in my opinion, this is also what makes web mapping exciting.

			<p>The idea that "maps also produce the world as we know it" is provocative and powerful. As a child of the 1980s I have one foot planted in Generation X skepticism and Generation Y narcissism. I expect my world, my consumption, and my media be algorithmically produced to meet my needs, I'm also terrified of this. It is important we are vigilant of our world, our "produced" world. But how do we engage with this world, how do we impact our experience in this world? For me, creating maps eases the fear Floating Sheep Manifesto point number one triggers. Generating my representation of data feels good, it makes the world seem slightly less unwieldy.
