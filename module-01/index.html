			<p> As the Floating Sheep manifesto states the true coder, cartographer, or critic types only exist in the wild. After thoroughly enjoying time away from formal education I decided I wanted to learn how to make maps. I re-enrolled at the University of Kentucky in 2009. Over the last 5 years my goal has remained the same yet it has been totally re-imagined. At different times through the years and this re-imagining I have identified with each of the three types. I consider myself to be blend of the three types currently heavy on the excited and totally inexperienced coder. I have learned that making maps is more than a hard skill and a particular technique. My priority moving forward with mapping is that I continue to learn. This now a requirement in the flexible and powerful world of web mapping but, in my opinion, this is also what makes web mapping exciting.

			<p>The idea that "maps also produce the world as we know it" is provocative and powerful. As a child of the 1980s I personally have one foot planted in Generation X skepticism and Generation Y narcissism. I expect the my world, my consumption, my media to be produced to be useful for me. I'm also terrified of this. I think it is important for us to be mindful of what "produces" our world, but how do we do that? For me, creating maps eases the fear Floating Sheep Manifesto point #1 triggers. Generating my own representation of data feels good, it makes the world seem slightly less unwieldy.
